# SDF1
Roguelike in Godot

## INTRO
> A massive, transforming alien battleship crash-lands on Earth; its inhabitants, realizing there are antagonistic aliens somewhere out in the universe, retrofit the ship and christen it the SDF-1

The plan: to do develop a small roguelike in vanilla GDscript, and release on multiple platforms.

## TODO (for now)

- [ ] add concept art
- [ ] draw pixel art
- [ ] set up project in godot
